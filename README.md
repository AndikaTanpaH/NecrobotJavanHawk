This for visual ~~Necrobot (v0.8.6)~~ Necrobot Forked (v0.9.0) if any update from there i'll update this page. Don't forget to [create issue](https://github.com/AndikaTanpaH/NecrobotJavanHawk/issues) if you found any bug or feature request to improve this JavanHawk. I hope you happy at all :D

Hmmm hell yaaah, Necrobot its shutdown.. But the JavanHawk still can run (If you know what i means, just back with a time machine)

I just test with Necrobot Forked (v0.8.8) worked.. The websocket still there, maybe need improvment for Level Up Pokemon.
